# SOP: Ticket Triage Checklist (L1 Service Desk)

**Audience:** L1 Service Desk  
**Goal:** Standardise how new tickets are assessed, prioritised, and routed.

---

## 1. When to Use

Apply this checklist to **every new ticket**, regardless of the channel:

- Phone  
- Chat / email  
- Self-service portal

---

## 2. Core Information to Capture

For each ticket, record:

1. **Who is affected?**  
   - Single user / team / department / site / multiple sites.

2. **What exactly is happening?**  
   - Error message (quote it).  
   - What the user was doing at the time.

3. **Since when?**  
   - Date/time first noticed.  
   - Has it happened before?

4. **Impact on work:**  
   - Fully blocked / partially blocked / just a question.  
   - Any deadlines or customer impact?

5. **Environment:**  
   - Device type (laptop/desktop/mobile, corporate vs personal).  
   - Location (office, home, VPN).

6. **Self-help tried:**  
   - Reboot, different browser/app, different device, etc.

---

## 3. Priority Guidance (Example)

Use your local matrix; example:

- **P1 – Critical:**  
  - Many users or a site down, key revenue or safety impact.

- **P2 – High:**  
  - Single user blocked from critical work (e.g., finance payroll, contact centre).

- **P3 – Medium:**  
  - User inconvenienced or slowed but can still work.

- **P4 – Low:**  
  - “How do I…?” questions, cosmetic issues.

Always document **why** you set a specific priority.

---

## 4. Decide: L1 Resolution vs Escalation

- If a valid **SOP / KB article** exists:
  - Follow it step-by-step.  
  - Record each step and outcome.

- If no relevant SOP or you hit a **permission/technical boundary**:
  - Stop before guessing or risking damage.  
  - Prepare a clean handover using the template below.  
  - Escalate to the right L2/L3 queue.

---

## 5. Handover Template (for Escalations)

When escalating, include:

- **Summary (1–2 lines):**  
  > “User in Finance cannot access shared drive ‘FIN-DATA’; started this morning.”

- **Impact & priority justification**  
- **Steps taken so far (+ timestamps)**  
- **Results of checks** (logs, screenshots, test accounts)  
- **Any hypothesis** you have (optional but useful)  

Good triage and handover reduces back-and-forth and builds trust with L2/L3.

---

## 6. Closing the Ticket

When resolved:

- Confirm with user that they can work normally.  
- Summarise the fix in simple language.  
- Link the ticket to any relevant **KB** or **incident** for future reference.
