# Escalation Checklist (L1 Service Desk)

Use this checklist before sending any ticket to L2/L3.

---

## 1. Basic Info Collected?

- [ ] User’s full name and contact details  
- [ ] Department / location / device type  
- [ ] Clear problem statement in user’s own words  
- [ ] Time issue started  

If any of these are missing → call/chat/email user to fill gaps.

---

## 2. Impact Assessed?

- [ ] Is user completely blocked or partially impacted?  
- [ ] Any deadlines / customer impact mentioned?  
- [ ] Checked whether others are affected (team / site / multiple sites)?  
- [ ] Priority set with **reason** in the ticket?

---

## 3. SOP / KB Followed?

- [ ] Search performed in KB/portal for relevant article.  
- [ ] Most suitable SOP identified and followed.  
- [ ] Each step and outcome logged in the ticket.  

If there is **no** suitable SOP → mention “No KB found for this scenario”.

---

## 4. Basic Technical Checks Done?

Examples (depending on problem type):

- [ ] Device rebooted / alternative browser/device tested  
- [ ] Network connectivity checked (if connection issue)  
- [ ] Service status page / vendor status checked  
- [ ] Permissions/licensing viewed (if access issue)

---

## 5. Clean Handover Prepared?

- [ ] Short summary (1–2 lines) at top of ticket  
- [ ] Timeline of key events  
- [ ] Results of checks performed  
- [ ] Error messages and screenshots attached  
- [ ] Any workaround in place clearly documented

---

## 6. Routing Correct?

- [ ] Escalation is going to the **right** team/queue.  
- [ ] Only **one** owner team at a time (avoid “everyone and no one”).  

---

If all boxes are ticked, escalate using the **Handover Template** and monitor for updates.
