## Timeline

- `HH:MM` – User first noticed issue

## Checks Performed by L1

Bullet the key steps:

- User identity verified.  
- Tried on another device / browser / network (results).  
- Checked service status / incident pages.  
- Followed \<SOP name\> steps: (brief outcome).  

Include commands run or tools used if relevant.

---

## Current Findings

- Symptoms that are **confirmed**.  
- Scope (who/where) as far as known.  
- Any patterns (only on VPN, only on Wi-Fi, only in one region, etc.).

---

## Workaround (If Any)

- Workaround implemented? `Yes/No`  
- If yes, describe and note limitations.

---

## Request from L2/L3

Be explicit about what you need:

- e.g. “Check mailbox health on server side”  
- e.g. “Verify firewall rules after last night’s change”  
- e.g. “Review VPN gateway logs for user during 09:00–09:15”

## Attachments

- Screenshots.  
- Log snippets.  
- Links to monitoring dashboards (if allowed).

This structure keeps escalations clean and makes L1 look professional.
